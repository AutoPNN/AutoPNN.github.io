                        AutoPNN will implements a holistic cross-layer approach which aims in minimizing, in an automated 
                        manner, the hardware-requirements of the printed ML classifier at all possible levels in order to exploit the
                        full potential of approximate computing and maximize the obtained hardware gains. To achieve this,
                        AutoPNN applies a hardware-aware Neural Architectures Search (NAS) followed by neural minimization
                        (software approximation) and an approximate hardware architecture search. At the software level, AutoPNN
                        will produce a simplified PNN with the minimum possible hardware overheads. Hardware-driven software
                        approximations can deliver significant hardware savings since they are able to remove coarse hardware
                        structures at the expense of only a little accuracy loss.
